        <p>When a family’s finances collapse, the fallout doesn’t just affect the people under the roof; it also impacts the pets. Across the country, shelters are seeing the consequences firsthand due to the economic state of the world since COVID-19: more animals arriving at their doors, fewer resources to care for them, and a rising urgency that’s hard to ignore.</p>

        <p>The economic challenges of 2025 are having a significant impact on animal shelters in the United States. As financial hardships and the housing market increase rapidly, many pet owners are forced to surrender their animals. This increase in surrendered pets is a main concern for shelters and has led to overcrowding, making it more difficult to manage animal resources and provide proper care. With the rising costs of rescue operations, shelters are facing financial strain while trying to address the growing issue of neglected animals.</p>

        <p>At Orange County Animal Care in California, Public Information Officer Alexa Pratt shared how the shelter has adapted to meet the increasing demand, especially since COVID. She explained that a combination of factors is driving the crisis: the rising cost of living has made pet ownership unaffordable for many; some landlords or apartment complexes don’t allow pets; and there’s been an increase in animals due to backyard breeding and unspayed or unneutered pets becoming strays.</p>

        <p>In 2024, the shelter took in over 12,000 animals, about 1,000 more than the previous year. Pratt emphasized that they do not euthanize for space and always work to create additional room wherever possible.</p>

        <p>Similar stories are unfolding at the Arizona Humane Society, where animal behavioral worker Joy Greenberg has witnessed firsthand the pandemic’s lasting impact on pet owners. She explains that many of the animals brought into the shelter are “COVID pets” that are adopted during the pandemic but now surrendered due to rising costs or life changes.</p>

        <p>“Many pets are being given up due to evictions or the loss of housing,” she says. “Some are even abandoned in apartments or houses.”</p>

        <p>Greenberg says they are fortunate to be privately funded by the Bissell and Walton families, who own major companies like Walmart. However, because the shelter doesn’t rely on federal funding, she worries that a declining economy could reduce donations and make it harder to provide proper care for the animals. “We’ve also started seeing people abandon animals, often with notes and medical histories, because they are fleeing the country,” Greenberg adds.</p>

        <p>Greenberg hopes that, in the future, there will be stricter laws defining animal abuse and a reduced need for animal shelters.</p>

        <p>On the East Coast, Marguerite Pearson, Senior Director of Marketing and Communications at the Mohawk Hudson Humane Society in New York, is witnessing the same problem. Inside the shelter, Pearson said they work hard to manage animal intakes to avoid constantly exceeding capacity. In the past, they faced difficult situations with no available space. “We were housing dogs in offices and things like that, and it's really not ideal. It's not safe for the people or the animals if they're not in a proper enclosure.”</p>

        <p>According to Pearson, the shelter is funded entirely by donations, and all of its operations depend on how much money is raised through fundraising. Because they don’t receive government funding, the Mohawk Hudson Humane Society has to closely review its budget each year and sometimes raise fees for services and adoptions to ensure they can provide animals with food, medicine, and individualized care.</p>

        <p>Second Chance Canine Adoption Shelter in Jamesville, New York, is also feeling the strain of economic pressures. During a visit, workers Carol Wolkensdorfer and Patrick Wickersham shared the stories of some current residents, including Lylah and LA. Lylah was found as a puppy, abandoned on the side of the road, and LA was surrendered to the shelter after his owner passed away.</p>

        <p>They explained that the family was unable to care for LA, so they surrendered him to the shelter. According to Wolkensdorfer, when LA was dropped off, the family left all his belongings: his bed, toys, and basically everything. As the car pulled away, LA was left sitting in the lobby with all of his things. This is just one of many stories that highlight the harsh reality of animal surrenders.</p>

        <p>Visiting the Second Chance Canine Adoption Shelter, it’s impossible not to feel the gravity of the situation. The shelter is small, located next to a prison, and every animal that walks through its doors carries a story of hardship, loss, or abandonment.</p>

        <p>Wolkensdorfer and Wickersham explained how challenging it has become to care for so many animals with limited resources. Like other shelters, Second Chance relies on donations to survive, and with fewer people able to contribute due to financial strain, the shelter has been forced to make difficult decisions.</p>

        <p>As shelters across the country face similar challenges, the stories of Lylah, LA, and countless other animals underscore the undeniable impact of the ongoing economic crisis.</p>

        <p>As the economy changes, so do the lives of animals. Shelters across the country are facing mounting challenges, relying on the dedication of workers, volunteers, and community support to continue providing care. As financial hardships grow, shelters are calling for immediate action and increased support to ensure they can continue saving lives.</p>
